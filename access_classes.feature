Feature: Access Classes

# continuous FG scanning (Tsched == 0) is already tested in the QoS or channel configurations, we will skip this here

@loop @bg
Scenario Outline: Node performing background scan is accessible
    Given an access profile using <channel_class> channel class <coding> coding with one subband which has a scan automation period of <tsched>
    And a testdevice using this access profile
    And a DUT, using this access profile
    When the testdevice executes a query (in a loop), forwarded to the D7ASP interface using this access class
    Then the requester should receive the responses
    Examples: example1
    | channel_class | coding | tsched  |
    | lo            | PN9    | 1024    |
    | lo            | FEC    | 1024    |
#    | lo            | PN9    | 512     |
#    | lo            | FEC    | 512     |
#    | normal        | PN9    | 1024    |
#    | normal        | FEC    | 1024    |
#    | normal        | PN9    | 512     |
#    | normal        | FEC    | 512     |
    #| hi            | PN9    | 1024    |
    #| hi            | FEC    | 1024    |
    #| hi            | PN9    | 512     |
    #| hi            | FEC    | 512     |


@loop @bg
Scenario Outline: Node performing background scan is accessible, using UID
    Given an access profile using <channel_class> channel class <coding> coding with one subband which has a scan automation period of <tsched>
    And a testdevice using this access profile
    And a DUT, using this access profile
    When the testdevice executes a query (in a loop), forwarded to the D7ASP interface using this access class for a specific UID
    Then the requester should receive the responses
    Examples: example1
    | channel_class | coding | tsched  |
    | lo            | FEC    | 1024    |

@loop @bg
Scenario Outline: Node performing background scan is not accessible, when using wrong UID
    Given an access profile using <channel_class> channel class <coding> coding with one subband which has a scan automation period of <tsched>
    And a testdevice using this access profile
    And a DUT, using this access profile
    When the testdevice executes a query (in a loop), forwarded to the D7ASP interface using this access class for a specific (wrong) UID
    Then the requester should not receive the responses

    Examples: example1
    | channel_class | coding | tsched  |
    | lo            | FEC    | 1024    |
